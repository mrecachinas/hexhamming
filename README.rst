What does it do?
----------------

This module performs a fast bitwise hamming distance of two hexadecimal strings.

This looks like::

    DEADBEEF = 11011110101011011011111011101111
    00000000 = 00000000000000000000000000000000
    XOR      = 11011110101011011011111011101111
    Hamming  = number of ones in DEADBEEF ^ 00000000 = 24

This essentially amounts to

::

    >>> import gmpy
    >>> gmpy.popcount(0xdeadbeef ^ 0x00000000)
    24

except with Python strings, so

::

    >>> import gmpy
    >>> gmpy.popcount(int("deadbeef", 16) ^ int("00000000", 16))
    24

A few assumptions are made and enforced:

* this is a valid hexadecimal string (i.e., ``[a-fA-F0-9]+``)
* the strings are the same length
* the strings do not begin with ``"0x"``

Why yet another Hamming distance library?
-----------------------------------------

There are a lot of fantastic (python) libraries that offer methods to calculate
various edit distances, including Hamming distances: Distance, textdistance,
scipy, jellyfish, etc.

In this case, I needed a hamming distance library that worked on hexadecimal
strings (i.e., a Python ``str``) and performed blazingly fast.
Furthermore, I often did not care about hex strings greater than 256 bits.
That length constraint is different vs all the other libraries and enabled me
to explore vectorization techniques via ``numba``, ``numpy``, and
``SSE/AVX`` intrinsics.

Lastly, I wanted to minimize dependencies, meaning you do not need to install
``numpy``, ``gmpy``, ``cython``, ``pypy``, ``pythran``, etc.

Eventually, after playing around with ``gmpy.popcount``, ``numba.jit``,
``pythran.run``, ``numpy``, I decided to write what I wanted
in essentially raw C. At this point, I'm using raw ``char*`` and
``int*``, so exploring re-writing this in Fortran makes little sense.

Installation
-------------

To install, ensure you have Python 2.7 or 3.4+. Run

::

    pip install hexhamming

or to install from source

::

    git clone https://github.com/mrecachinas/hexhamming
    cd hexhamming
    python setup.py install # or pip install .

If you want to contribute to hexhamming, you should install the dev
dependencies

::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

and make sure the tests pass with

::

    python -m pytest -vls .

Example
-------

Using ``hexhamming`` is as simple as

::

    >>> from hexhamming import hamming_distance_string
    >>> hamming_distance_string("deadbeef", "00000000")
    24

**New in v2.0.0** : ``hexhamming`` now supports `byte`s via ``hamming_distance_bytes``.
You use it in the exact same way as before, except you pass in a byte string.

::

    >>> from hexhamming import hamming_distance_bytes
    >>> hamming_distance_bytes(b"\xde\xad\xbe\xef", b"\x00\x00\x00\x00")
    24

Benchmark
---------

Below is a benchmark using ``pytest-benchmark`` with hexhamming==v1.3.2
my 2020 2.0 GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 16 GB 3733 MHz LPDDR4 macOS Catalina (10.15.5)
with Python 3.7.3 and Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.62).
